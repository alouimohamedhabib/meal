                Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the
                blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language
                ocean.
    
                It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.
